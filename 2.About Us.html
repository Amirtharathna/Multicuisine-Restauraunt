        <h3><u>Tandoori</u></h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;Tandoori chicken is a chicken dish prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yoghurt and
            spices in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish originated from the Indian subcontinent and is
            popular in many other parts of the world.The heat for a tandoor was traditionally generated by a charcoal or
            wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live fire, radiant heat cooking, and
            hot-air, convection cooking, and smoking in the fat and food juices that drip on to the
            charcoal.Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 °C (900 °F), and it is common for tandoor ovens to
            remain lit for long periods to maintain the high cooking temperature. The tandoor design is something of a
            transitional form between a makeshift earth oven and the horizontal-plan masonry oven.</p>

            <h3><u>South Indian</u></h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Indian cuisine includes the cuisines of the five southern states of India—Andhra
                Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana—and the union territories of Lakshadweep,
                Pondicherry, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The cuisines of Andhra Pradesh are the spiciest in all
                of India. Generous use of chili and tamarind make the dishes tangy and hot. The majority of dishes are
                vegetable- or lentil-based.Karnataka has a very diverse cuisine. Some of the most popular and
                traditional south Indian breakfast preparations like idli, vada and masala dosa are believed to have
                originated in the temple streets of Udupi in Karnataka. Described as being the mildest in terms of spice
                content among the cuisines of the five south Indian states, the traditional cuisine of Karnataka is
                known for its generous use of jaggery, palm sugar and limited use of chili powder.Kerala cuisine is very
                diverse, a diversity is best classified on the basis of the various communities. The Syrian Christian
                dishes and Malabari Muslim dishes are famous. </p>

            <h3><u>Chettinad</u></h3>
        </center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chettinad cuisine is known for its use of a variety of spices in preparing mainly
            non-vegetarian food. The dishes are hot and pungent with fresh ground masalas, and topped with a boiled egg
            that is usually considered an essential part of a meal. They also use a variety of sun-dried meats and
            salted vegetables, reflecting the dry environment of the region. The meat is restricted to fish, prawn,
            lobster, crab, chicken and mutton. Chettiars do not eat beef and pork.

            Most of the dishes are eaten with rice and rice-based accompaniments such as dosais, appams, idiyappams,
            adais and idlis. The Chettinad people, through their mercantile contacts with Burma, learnt to prepare a
            type of rice pudding made with sticky red rice.

            Chettinad cuisine offers a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Some of the popular vegetarian
            dishes include idiyappam, paniyaram, vellai paniyaram, karuppatti paniyaram, paal paniyaram, kuzhi
            paniyaram, kozhakattai, masala paniyaram, adikoozh, kandharappam, seeyam, masala seeyam, kavuni arisi and
            athirasam.</p>

            <h3><u>North Indian</u></h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Indian cuisine is a part of Indian cuisine, from the region of Northern India
                which includes the Pakistani provinces: Punjab, AJK and Indian states and union territories: Jammu and
                Kashmir, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
                . This is also a major cuisine in the Northern-Eastern regions like western Bihar (especially Bhojpuri
                cuisine), excluding cuisine of Mithilanchal) as well as central regions like Madhya Pradesh.</p>

                <h3><u>Chinese</u></h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine
                    originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the
                    world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has
                    influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese
                    food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and
                    the wok, can now be found worldwide.</p>

                    <h3><u>European</u></h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European cuisine, or alternatively western cuisine, is a generalised term
                        collectively referring to the cuisines of Europe and other Western countries,including that of
                        Russia, as well as non -indigenous cuisines of the Americas, Oceania, and Southern Africa, which
                        derive substantial influence from European settlers in those regions. The term is used by East
                        Asians to contrast with Asian styles of cooking, analogous to Westerners' referring collectively
                        to the cuisines of East Asian countries as Asian cuisine.</p>

                        <h3><u>Cakes</u></h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cake is a form of sweet food that is usually baked. In their oldest forms,
                            cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that
                            can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries,
                            meringues, custards, and pies. The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar,
                            eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or
                            baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or
                            fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the
                            primary ingredients.</p>

                            <h3><u>Desserts</u></h3>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course usually consists
                                of sweet foods, such as confections dishes or fruit, and possibly a beverage such as
                                dessert wine or liqueur, however in the United States it may include coffee, cheeses,
                                nuts, or other savory items regarded as a separate course elsewhere. In some parts of
                                the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China, there is
                                no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.The term dessert can apply to many
                                confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries,
                                pies, puddings, and sweet soups, and tarts.</p>

                                <h3><u>Juices</u></h3>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juice is a drink made from the extraction or pressing of the
                                    natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that
                                    are flavored with concentrate or other biological food sources, such as meat or
                                    seafood, such as clam juice. Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an
                                    ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, as for smoothies. Juice emerged
                                    as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods enabled
                                    its preservation without using fermentation.</p>
